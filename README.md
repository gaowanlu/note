## LIFE

Financial Independence, Retire Early

1. The FIRE movement prioritizes saving and investing 50% or more of your income so that you can retire early.
2. FIRE followers dramatically reduce their expenses, seek ways to increase income, and invest heavily.
3. Many FIRE followers also go by the rule of 25, saving 25 times your annual expenses to retire, and the 4% rule, withdrawing 4% or less per year.
4. FIRE is popular among millennials, but because of the strict expense cuts, it may not work for everyone.
